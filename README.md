Description: Designed a Single-ended output Folded Cascode [Differential amplifier + common gate stage] OPAMP. Used PMOS as the input transistor.
a)	Analog schematic for OTA
b)	Analysis of all equations for OTA, with a systematic derivation of all transistors W/L ratios and spectre simulation of circuit for the following specifications.
i)	ICMR ≥ 1.8 V
ii)	CMRR ≥120dB
iii)	output Swing ≥ 2V
c)	Shown a biasing circuitry to bias all the voltages in your design (except the input).
d)	Used STB analysis to measure the closed loop gain and phase margin.
e)	Calculations and Plots of the following parameters for the OPAMP: DC gain, Bode plot for AC gain and phase, CMRR plot, ICMR plot, PSRR plot, slew rate, Output voltage swing (dc + Transient), power consumption, and input and output offset voltage.
